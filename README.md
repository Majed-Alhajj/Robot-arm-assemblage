Robot arm structure

Objective:

The main goal of this report To help the reader to Rebuild this robot arm easily and with the whole understanding of the robot arm function.

Equipments:

This robot arm is contain of these Parts: 
1.	Base 
2.	First arm
3.	Second arm
4.	Waist 
5.	Gripper

Methods: 

A.	Building robot arm Using 3D design software:
1.	Bring the base and the waist and to link them easliy you should click on the order constrain then choose mate try to link both of the using the edge of the waist and conect it with the edge of the base.
2.	Conneect the arm from the side of the joint with the waist using the order constrain then choose mate.
3.	Conneect the second arm with the first arm from the round side using the order constrain then choose mate.
4.	Connect the gripper with second arm from the rectangular side using the order constrain then choose mate.

B.	Building robot arm in headquarters:
1.	You will need to secure the base to the board of the robot base using M3 secrws and then you will take the waist and link it with the the base.
2.	You will take the waist and link it with the first arm but to be able to link them at the beginning we will need to the waist servo. We simply put it in place and secure it to the 3D printed part using self-tapping screws, two screws up and two down.

3.	From the other side of the waist The round horn is secured to the waist part using the self-tapping screws that come as accessories with the servo, and then the round horn is secured to servo shaft using the appropriate bolts that also come with the servo.

4.	Now you can link the first arm with waist since the round horn goes on the next part, and then the two parts are secured to each other using a bolt on the output shaft of the servo. We should note that before securing the parts, we need to make sure that the part has the full range of motion. So add a rubber band to the waist joint so that it gives a little bit help to the servo, because this servo carries the weight of the rest of the arm as well as the payload.
5.	Now You will take the second arm and link it with the first arm but to be able to link them you will need to the connect the second arm servo. you simply put it in place and secure it to the 3D printed part using self-tapping screws, two screws up and two down.

6.	From the other side of the second arm The round horn is secured to the second arm part using the self-tapping screws that also come as accessories with the servo, and then the round horn is secured to servo shaft using the appropriate bolts that also come with the servo.
7.	Now you can link the first arm with the second arm since the round horn goes on the next part, and then the two parts are secured to each other using a bolt on the output shaft of the servo.

8.	Now we need to assemble the gripper. The gripper is controlled with a servo motor, on which, first we attach a custom designed geared link. We pair this link with another geared link on the other side, which is secured using M3 bolt and nuts. all other links are connected using M3 bolts and nuts.

9.	Once you assembled the gripper, you secured it to the last servo and From the other side of the gripper the round horn is secured to the gripper part using the self-tapping screws that also come as accessories with the servo and then you can link the second arm with the gripper since the round horn goes on the next part, and then the two parts are secured to each other using a bolt on the output shaft of the servo. Now the robot arm is ready.

You might need to use a zip-tie to secure all the wires together (depends on the way you want to connect them with the Arduino board).
